# AI Project Pentago-Swap
Got the 1st place in class. 
Implemented an AI agent play on the board game named Pentago-Swap, which is a 2-player game on a 6x6 board which consists of 4 3x3 quadrants. Winning state can be achieved by having 5 pieces in a row with the rule that any 2 of 4 quadrants can be swapped. 
The time constraint is 30 secs for first move and 2 secs for sub-moves.
